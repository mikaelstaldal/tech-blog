I just brought an [Sveon SNT1020 WiFi USB adapter][1].

It works very well with Ubuntu Linux 10.10, just connect it to an USB 2 port and you can start using it with NetworkManager right away, no drivers or setup necessary. You should possibly disable any built-in WiFi adapters first though.

It cost €35.
