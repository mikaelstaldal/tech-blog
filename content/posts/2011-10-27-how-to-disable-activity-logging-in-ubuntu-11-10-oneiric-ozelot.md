Ubuntu has mechanism to log user activity such as used documents. This is used to facilitate searching, but can also be intrusive to your privacy.

Here is a way to disable this logging without breaking Unity or any other part of the system, execute these commands in a terminal:

  1. `sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop-inactive`
  2. `rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel`
  3. `mkdir ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel`
  4. `rm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist`

then log out and log in again.
