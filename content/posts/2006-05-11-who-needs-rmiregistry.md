[Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)][1] contains a tool _[rmiregistry][2]_ to run a stand-alone remote object registry. According to the [RMI tutorial][3], _rmiregistry_ is normally used in an RMI application.

I wonder why. It&#8217;s actually almost as simple to run the remote object registry within the RMI server. You only have to use `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry#createRegistry(int port)` method like this:

```
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(port);
registry.bind("Foo", stub);
```

[Here][4] is a complete example.

This is also more efficient since you don&#8217;t have to start a separate JVM for the registry. Running the registry within the RMI server doesn&#8217;t even require an extra thread, the registry is just another remote object.

Does anyone know about any sensible reasons for using _rmiregistry_?
